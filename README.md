- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kmachappy
- 👀 I’m interested in everything I keep an opened mind about all perspectives and aspects of life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything. Knowledge to me is not a choice. I'll learn from diy projects, mechanichal to software.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I will start creating a automotive software for collision estimating.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
